# s_torrent

S_Torrent is a learning project of mine. The goal is to write a torrent client in python to interpret and download an ISO as described by the .torrent file.

[x] Create asynchronous calls
[ ] Interpret .torrent file into usable info
[ ] Download and save ISO locally

All of this will be further broken down into individual steps and commits.
